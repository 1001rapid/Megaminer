-One file config (config.txt)

-Fastest miner for each algo preselected for Nvidia Pascal (08/01/2017)

-AutoRelaunch Powershell on main file fail

--Skunk algo is faster on ccminerSkunk, but is very unestable, you can try ccminerPalginSkunk by comment/uncomment(with # before)  "skunk" = "" line on ps1 file on miner folder

-multiple drci test for eth/sia dual mining on MPH




---- INSTRUCTIONS ------

1.Edit CONFIG.TXT file before mining
